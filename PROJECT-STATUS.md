# Priorities — Project Status

> **For Claude Code (and anyone reading the repo): this is the living source of truth for project state.** Update this file every time you make a meaningful change — milestone progress, items resolved, new known issues, phase transitions. Keep entries concise. The "Last Updated" line at the top must be set to the current date on every change.

## Last Updated

2026-05-03

## Phase Status

| Phase | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Design | ✅ Complete | All 8 design and reference documents finalized and audited (Vision, FDD, TDD, Project Status, Setup Walkthrough, Sub-App Workflow, Flow Template, Exec Summary). Ready to build. |
| Phase 1 (v1 platform build) | 🔨 In Progress | Started 2026-05-03 with M1 scaffold |
| Phase 2 (sub-app extensions + platform improvements) | 📋 Planned | See Phase 2 Backlog below |

## v1 Build Progress

20-milestone build order from TDD's "Build Order Recommendation" section. Two additive deviations applied (see plan: cost circuit breaker pulled forward to M12; data export added to M19). Status: ⬜ Not started, 🔨 In progress, ✅ Done.

| # | Milestone | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Project scaffold (Next.js 15 + Tailwind v4 + Drizzle + Lucia magic link) | 🔨 | Code written 2026-05-03 — empty Next.js app, design docs preserved at root, `PROJECT-STATUS.md` copied from `priorities-project-status.md`. Files staged for git commit but not yet committed (git user.name/user.email not configured locally; owner must complete the initial commit). Acceptance gate pending: empty app deploys to Vercel preview URL and `/` returns 200. |
| 2 | Database setup + magic link auth flow (signin, auth callback, signout) | ⬜ | Includes `users`, `sessions`, `magic_link_tokens` tables, Resend integration, replay protection (TDD §Subsystem 7) |
| 3 | User settings + Settings page skeleton | ⬜ | Tabs, profile tab, API key tab with AES-GCM encryption |
| 4 | Priorities table + Council Home (Priorities List) read-only | ⬜ | Static list display first |
| 5 | Manual Priority CRUD + drag-to-reorder (@dnd-kit) + pause/archive | ⬜ | Optimistic UI on reorder; selective-cascade soft-delete |
| 6 | Priority Detail page with full edit | ⬜ | All structured core fields, memory entries CRUD, file uploads |
| 7 | Quarters table + first-quarter calculation logic + display in Priorities List header | ⬜ | Includes Subsystem 10 `ensureCurrentQuarter` middleware |
| 8 | Tasks + Events tables + manual CRUD via Priority Detail | ⬜ | Foundation for planning to populate later. Includes `instance_of_*_id` columns and recurrence schema (Subsystem 12) + read-side helpers |
| 9 | Daily View page (today's Tasks + Events, checkboxes, date navigation) | ⬜ | **End-to-end works at this point.** Manual life manager, no AI yet. |
| 10 | Calendar feed config + .ics ingestion + Vercel cron + display in Daily View | ⬜ | Includes `removed_from_source_at` reconciliation logic + Settings → Calendar tab |
| 11 | Quarter Plan UI scaffold (queue + chat + 13-week calendar layout) | ⬜ | Static UI, no chatbot yet |
| 12 | Quarter Planning chatbot per Priority (verbatim Prompt 4) + tool calls + persist quarter_week_focus + cost circuit breaker | ⬜ | First AI feature live. **Deviation 1**: cost circuit breaker primitives (`withinCostCap`, per-message + per-session cost tracking, `chat_sessions.total_cost_usd`) land here, not M19, since TDD §Security requires cap check before every LLM call. UI surfacing stays at M19. Includes `generation_locks` table + tool error handling (validation/concurrency/transient) |
| 13 | Weekly Plan UI + chatbot (Prompt 5) + persist Tasks/Events with target_date | ⬜ | Conflict resolution surfaces inline |
| 14 | Daily Plan UI + chatbot (Prompt 6) — 3-step evening review structure | ⬜ | Progress / Capture / Plan tomorrow + Settings → Planning tab |
| 15 | Re-planning mode picker (Replan all / Adjust) for all three horizons | ⬜ | |
| 16 | Master Chat — preview generation (Prompt 7) + screen context envelope from all relevant pages | ⬜ | Non-streaming structured output + `master_chat` single-flight lock |
| 17 | Master Chat — confirm execution + cancel + persistent history + staleness validation + scrollback pagination | ⬜ | Atomic batch execution; 5-min preview expiry; "Load older" pagination |
| 18 | Onboarding Coach (Prompts 1 + 2) + Council Proposal Review + accept handler + Mid-cycle Priority Onboarding banners (Subsystem 11) | ⬜ | Re-triggerable from Settings with Replace/Add modal |
| 19 | Cost surfacing UI (Settings → Cost & Usage tab) + cost cap banners + Memory Summarization (Subsystem 9, Prompt 8) + Data export (Settings → Data tab) | ⬜ | **Deviation 2**: Data export (acceptance criterion #13) explicitly slotted here |
| 20 | PWA manifest + service worker + polish pass (error states, empty states, loading skeletons, conflict feedback messaging, weekly time tracking display per Priority, markdown XSS audit) | ⬜ | |

## Open Items

### Critical (blocking or near-term)

- **Owner setup needed to close M1**: (1) configure git identity locally (`git config user.email <your-email>`, `git config user.name <your-name>`), (2) commit staged files, (3) create GitHub repo and push, (4) connect repo to Vercel, (5) verify the empty app deploys and `/` returns 200 on the preview URL. Once that's confirmed, M1 status → ✅.
- **Owner setup needed before M2**: create Neon database (get `DATABASE_URL`), create Resend account (get `RESEND_API_KEY` + verify sender), generate `API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (`openssl rand -base64 32`), set env vars in Vercel. See `.env.example` for the full list. Per TDD §Build Approach, the dev environment is claude.ai/code in cloud sandboxes — this scaffold session was on Windows desktop without Node.js, so no `npm install` was run locally. First Vercel build will install dependencies and generate the lockfile.

### Important (next iteration)

- **Lucia v3 dropped from dependencies (2026-05-03).** The maintainer sunset Lucia in late 2024; `@lucia-auth/adapter-postgresql@3.x` has a peer dep on `@neondatabase/serverless@"0.7 - 0.9"` which conflicts with the latest Neon driver and broke the M1 Vercel build. Per the maintainer's official guidance, M2 will implement magic-link + session management directly using `oslo` (crypto primitives — already in deps) + Drizzle (sessions table). No functional change to the plan. TDD §Stack still says "Lucia magic link" — interpret that as "magic link auth, conventionally Lucia-style sessions in DB," not literal Lucia usage.

### Nice-to-have (backlog)

_None yet — populate as issues surface during build._

## Acceptable v1 Limitations (Known Gaps)

These are documented in the TDD as "Edge Cases & Limitations." They are intentional v1 scope decisions, not bugs.

**Functional:**
- No deduplication of Tasks/Events across Priorities
- Plan does not adapt mid-day; static once daily plan is set
- No notifications (push or email)
- No offline writes (read-only when offline)
- No bi-directional calendar sync (read-only .ics ingestion)
- No voice input
- No advanced visualizations (no radar charts, no progress charts beyond per-Priority weekly time tracking)
- No search across council / memory / chat history
- No yearly planning ritual (yearly notes only, attached to Priorities ambiently)
- **Sub-app integration is fully designed in FDD/sub-app workflow doc but NOT IMPLEMENTED in v1.** No "Connect a sub-app" UI in v1.
- No trash recovery UI (soft-deleted items recoverable via export only)
- No multi-user / sharing
- No council templates beyond what Onboarding Coach generates
- Minutes-per-week is tracking-only — no hard enforcement

**Technical/operational:**
- No rate limiting on own API endpoints (single-user v1)
- No formal email verification (magic link is the substitute)
- No user-facing audit log of changes
- No automated tests beyond manual verification
- No formal observability stack (Vercel logs + chat_sessions cost tracking only)
- No edge runtime optimization
- No connection pool tuning beyond Neon serverless defaults
- No master chat undo for confirmed actions (must issue a new master chat command to reverse)
- Council UX optimized for ≤20 active Priorities
- Cost pricing constants in app config may drift from Anthropic's actual pricing
- Encryption key rotation requires manual user action (re-enter API key)

## Phase 2 Backlog

### Sub-app extensions to design (each gets its own design pass)

The first sub-app to get built triggers actual implementation of the sub-app contract per `priorities-sub-app-workflow.md`. Each sub-app is a standalone repo + PWA that plugs into a specific Priority via the documented contract.

Health-domain candidates:
- Gym Coach (sheet music–style training program with periodization)
- Meal Planner (store-aware grocery lists, recipe browser, macro tracking)
- Medical Manager (treatment timelines, prescriptions, appointments)
- Sleep Tracker

Recreation/Creativity candidates:
- Piano Coach (repertoire browser, sheet music references, practice log)
- Vacation Planner (trip itinerary, budget, packing list)
- Hobby Tracker

Relationships candidates:
- Date Planner
- Friends/Family Maintenance

Career, Money, Personal Growth candidates:
- Career Coach
- Budget Tracker
- Reading List Manager

### Platform improvements (post-v1.0)

- Sub-app contract implementation (when first sub-app gets built)
- Real MCP wire format adoption (when portability matters)
- Trash recovery UI for soft-deleted items
- Search across all data
- Master chat undo for confirmed actions
- Smart memory summarization beyond the threshold-based pattern (RAG with vector embeddings)
- Native iOS/Android via React Native (Phase 2 stack rebuild)
- Push notifications
- Item dedup across Priorities
- Bi-directional calendar sync (write back to Outlook/Google via OAuth)
- Yearly horizon visualizations (yearly notes already captured in v1)
- Multi-user / sharing
- Council templates / starter scenarios beyond Onboarding Coach output
- Voice input for master chat
- Formal observability stack (Sentry, Vercel Analytics)
- Automated test suite (unit + integration + e2e)
- Encryption key versioning for graceful rotation
- Connection pool tuning if scale demands
- Edge runtime optimization for cold-start latency

## Recent Changes

Most recent at the top. Each entry: date + summary. Keep concise.

- **2026-05-03 (M1 fix)**: Removed `lucia` and `@lucia-auth/adapter-postgresql` from package.json — the adapter's peer-dep range broke the first Vercel build and Lucia v3 was sunset by its maintainer in late 2024. M2 will roll session management directly per Lucia's official sunset migration guidance (oslo + Drizzle).
- **2026-05-03 (M1 scaffold)**: Project scaffolded as Next.js 15 + Tailwind v4 + Drizzle + Lucia + shadcn-style utilities. Created `package.json` (deps from TDD §Stack package list), `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `drizzle.config.ts`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`. Initial folder layout: `src/app/`, `src/db/`, `src/lib/`, plus stub `src/db/schema.ts` (populated milestone-by-milestone) and `src/db/client.ts` (Neon serverless). Created `src/lib/utils.ts` (cn helper) and `src/lib/id.ts` (`<prefix>_<nanoid(16)>` helper). Initial routes: `/` placeholder home + `/api/healthcheck`. README rewritten as project README pointing at design docs and PROJECT-STATUS. Git repo initialized. **Deviation tracking**: cost circuit breaker pulled forward to M12 (TDD §Security requires it before any LLM call); data export added to M19 (acceptance criterion #13).

- **2026-05-03 (final audit)**: Comprehensive cross-doc audit pass. Findings resolved:
  - Removed 3 stale "to be created/regenerated" notes from Exec Summary's Document Map (project-status, flow-template, sub-app-workflow are all created).
  - Fixed entity count: 12 → 13 entities (FDD entity model).
  - Fixed table count: 14 → 16 tables (TDD schema, after gap fixes added `magic_link_tokens` and `sessions`).
  - Added a "Recurring Tasks and Events" functional description to the FDD.
  - All other consistency checks passed.

- **2026-05-03**: Initial design package complete for Priorities. 8 documents finalized. Highlights:
  - Major paradigm shift from prior "Tend" design (Wheel-of-Life domains + agent contract) to Priorities (council of priority chatbots + three-horizon planning ritual).
  - Vision locked with 11 architectural decisions.
  - FDD locked with 11 workflows, 13 pages, 13 entities, 12 quality controls, 15 resolved decisions.
  - TDD hardened with 8 critical gap fixes plus 8 smaller hardening additions across Subsystems 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 plus Database Migrations section.
  - Total tables in TDD schema: 16. Total verbatim prompts: 8. Total subsystems: 12.
